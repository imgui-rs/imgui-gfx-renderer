# imgui-gfx

This is an ARCHIVED and DEPRECATED renderer. It works as of Oct 1 2021 on imgui 0.8.0, but
will not be updated. This is for pre-gfx-hal gfx, and so has very few users.

## `imgui-gfx-examples`

- Run with OpenGL backend: `cargo run --example gfx_hello_world`
- Run with DirectX backend: `cargo run --example gfx_hello_world --features directx --no-default-features`
